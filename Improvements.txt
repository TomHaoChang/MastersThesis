Sliding window is an established method of correlation recovery method

Why is TimeCorr better than sliding window
1. TimeCorr is better because no loss. Especially significant in the construction of Mixture Models. In addition, because some activities in the brain can be rapidly changing, information loss may result in loss of very important information. In addition, current fMRI technology may produce up to 50 brain images per second. 

2. In addition, TimeCorr is able to incorporate information from a wider range of time points for its calculations. Detect and recover changes with greater accuracy

3. Temporal resolution. Through the application of Gaussian Distribution, we gain more locations and temporal resolution.

4. TimeCorr is able to recover a wider range of dynamic correlation structures.

Because of the above advantages, TimeCorr is a better alternative to the sliding window method for recovery of dynamic functional connectivities.

Future Directions:
1. Hidden Markov Model for detection of Block Borders and then apply TimeCorr of varying variances to recovery dynamic correlation within each block

2. High-Order Brain Dynamics

3. Use alternative distributions to generate coefficients for even better temporal resolution (e.g. Laplacian Distribution)

Block: equal to block length produces best decoding accuracy. Going over block length makes TimeCorr pick up changes too early. While low variance produce lower decoding accuracy.
