1. High level functional connectivity -> relationship between interactions, relationship between interactions between interactions -> high level information may be very useful for understanding the dynamics of the brain, how each area work together. High level information also not accessible by analysis at low level, so analysis of low level alone may be lacking in information. Every time a correlation matrix is formed is equivalent to the formation of a mini-network. So overtime a new level of functional connectivity is obtained, we are essentially analyzing the dynamic relationship between larger and larger networks. 

2. PCA reduction of brain activities is division by similarity in activity. While regions with similar activity are combined, regions that display dissimilar patterns are isolated and highlighted. This process is inherently beneficial to functional connectivity analysis, as we are eliminating information redundancy from areas that display identical or similar activity, and place our focus on areas that possess greater differences in functionality. Intuitively, this also extends to higher levels, where interactions displaying similar relationship with the network are combined, resulting in highly informational correlation structures of very diverse networks.

3. Future improvements: Functional brain modules reconfigure at multiple scales across the human lifespan \citep{Betzel2015}
